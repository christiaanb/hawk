*  Set the env. variable HAWKROOT


*  the script "bin/makeall" in the root directory should build the
   library and models.  If you don't want to build everything
   then you can modify the script.


*  By default, the distribution builds the libraries and models
   with optimization flags on ---- meaning that a build will
   take forever!  You can shut the flags off by re-defining
     OPTSFLAGS=
   in lib/Config.mk
