The Arithmetic module defines the datatype "AluOp" to represent the
various sorts of operations you might pass to an ALU like circuit.
The "Instruction" class defines its methods to use AluOp as the
least-common denomiator (no pun intended) of arithmetic-based instructions.

{-

Cells are intended to be used to represent the source and destination
operands in machine instructions.  Consider, for example:
	
	r1=? <- r20=15 + 8

Here the first cell (r1=?) is a register reference, and its value is
not known yet.  The source cell r20=15 is a register reference with 
its value calculated.  8 is the other source operand --- in this 
case a constant.  The Cell class hopes to capture this notion, while
allowing you freedom to define richer Cell-like structures.

The Cell's interface supports register references, constants,
PCs, speculative PCs and predicates.

See the DLX_Cell module for a concrete instance

Currently several of the Cell methods overlap with each other ---- 
Eventually we will slim the methods to the minimum set.

   In practice it is nice to be able to place a probe on a signal.
   Suppose that "s" is a signal.  'probe "s.output" s' has the
   same meaning as 's' --- but s's contents have been written to 
   the file "s.output".   This function has turned out to be
   critical in the development of the Visio Hawk interface.

   Some issues to consider:
        * probe is a hack --- and it messes with referential 
          trancparency.  Some Haskell compilers may wreak havoc with
          probes.  
	* probe is pretty careful not to change the strictness
          behavior.
        * Avoid using probes within unit definitions.  If you duplicate
          the use of the unit, the output file will be written to 
          simultaniously by both units instantiations.  Try using probe
          only at the top-level of your microarchitecture.
