           CONDITIONS OF USE, DUPLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION (*)       

    Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute Hawk for any personal
    or educational use without fee is hereby granted, provided that:     

     a) This copyright notice is retained in both source code and            
        supporting documentation.                                            

     b) Modified versions of this software are redistributed only if     
        accompanied by a complete history (date, author, description) of 
        modifications made; the intention here is to give appropriate    
        credit to those involved, while simultaneously ensuring that any 
        recipient can determine the origin of the software.                  

     c) The same conditions are also applied to any software system          
        derived either in full or in part from Hawk.                 

    No part of Hawk may be distributed as a part or accompaniment of any 
    commercial package or product without the explicit written permission
    of the author and copyright holder.  The distribution of commercial  
    products which require or make use of Hawk will normally be permitted
    if the Hawk distribution is supplied separately to and offered at cost
    price to the purchaser of the commercial product.                

    In specifying these conditions, our intention is to permit widespread
    use of Hawk while, at the same time, protecting the interests, rights
    and efforts of all those involved.  Please contact the author and    
    copyright holder to arrange alternative terms and conditions if your 
    intended use of Hawk is not permitted by the terms and conditions in 
    this notice.                                                             

    NOTICE: Hawk is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty.

    (*) For the purposes of this document, the word "Hawk" refers both to
        the software and its accompanying documentation.
