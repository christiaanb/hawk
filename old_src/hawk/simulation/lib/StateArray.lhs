{-
	The following functions dealing with write-ranges are
	needed because the hugs interpreter is very slow in evaluating
	lazy monadic expressions involving lots of writes to a MutArr.
	Even simple programs output by dlxgcc ask to have about 16K-words
	of data to be initialized to zero, while other areas of memory
	should be initialized to an error value. These routines
	allow me to isolate what the majority of array locations should
	be initialized to; I can pass this initialization value to
	newArr (which is implemented as a primitive) to avoid most
	of the initial writes.
