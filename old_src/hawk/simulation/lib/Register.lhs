   Register captures the common instances and methods that is 
   usually required of a register-set like type.  Register 
   supports PCs, speculative PCs, and predicate registers.

        -- is the register read only?   for example, in DLX 
        --  r0 <- r0 + r0  is equivilant to a nop because r0 is read only
        readOnly :: a -> Bool

        -- pick out the PC register

        -- ispc and isspec should probably be defined as :
	--       ispc r = pc == r.  havent tested this though....
